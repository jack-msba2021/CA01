## Project Description
Exploratory Data Analysis is the process of analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics such as mean, standard deviation, count, and so on, often with visual methods. It's a very important step in data analysis and should be performed before any real complex statistical methods are conducted. This project attempts to practice the concepts of exploratory data analysis through the [India Air Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shrutibhargava94/india-air-quality-data) downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

The data was released by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and Central Pollution Control Board of India under the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP).  It includes important parameters such us SPM, RSPM, PM2.5, NO2, and SO2, which are used to measure the quality of air based on the number of particles present in it. Using these values, this project identifies the air quality over time in different states of India.
